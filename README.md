### RabbitMQ with Spring Boot
In this project the following RabbitMQ concepts are implemented:
* Publish and Consume events (Producer, Consumer)
* Dynamic Exchange, Queue addition through REST API
* Acknowledgement (Publish acknowledgement, Consume acknowledgement)

#### Steps to dynamically add exchange or queue
‚úÖ Expose a REST API to dynamically create:
* Exchange (Direct, Topic, or Fanout)
* Queue
* Routing Key and Binding

‚úÖ Use Spring AMQP (RabbitAdmin) to manage RabbitMQ dynamically.

‚úÖ Verify the newly created exchange, queue, and binding in RabbitMQ Management UI.

Add the RabbitAdmin bean as configuration, which allows us to create queues and exchanges dynamically.
```
    @Bean
    public RabbitAdmin rabbitAdmin(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
        return new RabbitAdmin(connectionFactory);
    }
```
The `RabbitMQController.java` class file in the project is responsible for exposing API's for dynamically adding exchange, queue and binding queue with exchange.

#### Publish and Consume acknowledgement
When a message is sent to RabbitMQ, we want to confirm that:

‚úÖ The message reached the exchange successfully.

‚úÖ The message was routed to a queue successfully.

üõ† How It Works

1. Enable Publisher Confirms (confirmCallback) ‚Üí Confirms message delivery to exchange.

2. Enable Return Callbacks (returnsCallback) ‚Üí Confirms message was routed to a queue.

In the `application.properties` add the following properties:
```
spring.rabbitmq.publisher-confirm-type=correlated
spring.rabbitmq.publisher-returns=true
spring.rabbitmq.template.mandatory=true
```

1. `spring.rabbitmq.publisher-confirm-type=correlated`
   
    This enables publisher confirms, allowing the producer to verify that RabbitMQ has received the message at the exchange level.
2. `spring.rabbitmq.publisher-returns=true`

   This enables return callbacks, allowing the producer to verify if the message was routed to a queue.
3. `spring.rabbitmq.template.mandatory=true`

   By default, messages that can‚Äôt be routed are discarded ‚ùå.

   This setting ensures unroutable messages are returned instead of being lost.

#### Configuration for acknowledgement
`RabbitCallbackConfig.java` class file implements the configuration for acknowledgement.

rabbitTemplate.setConfirmCallback() is for acknowledging if message reached to exchange or not.

rabbitTemplate.setReturnsCallback() is for acknowledging if message reached to queue or not.

#### Producer side
Send a `CorrelationData` for uniquely identify the message.

#### Consumer side acknowledgmemnt
1. Automatic Acknowledgement (ackMode=AUTO): RabbitMQ auto-acknowledges messages.

2. Manual Acknowledgement (ackMode=MANUAL): Consumer explicitly acknowledges after processing.

`RabbitMqConsumer.java` class implements the consumer with acknowledgement.
